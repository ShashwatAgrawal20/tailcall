# Testing Strategy to Ensure That Configurations Retain Their Original Structure and Information When Converted Between Supported Formats

## Overview

This document outlines a testing strategy to ensure that configurations, when converted between supported formats, retain their original structure and information. The goal is to develop a design and architecture that ensures inter-conversion identity.

Configuration conversion is an essential feature of `tc`, as it allows users to load configurations from a variety of file formats. It is important to ensure that configurations retain their original structure and information when converted between supported formats so that users can be confident that their configurations are being loaded correctly.

## Problem

`tc` has the capability to load configurations from various file formats, including .graphql, .yml, and .json. It is essential that these configurations, when converted from one format to another and then back again, retain their original structure and information without any loss. In other words, if a .graphql file is converted to .yml and then back to .graphql, the final file should be identical to the original .graphql file.

## Solution

The proposed testing strategy is based on the following principles:

- **Test coverage:** The test suite should cover all possible combinations of input and output formats.
- **Reproducibility:** The test suite should be reproducible and easy to maintain.
- **Efficiency:** The test suite should be efficient and run in a reasonable amount of time.

## Test Cases

The following test cases will be implemented to verify the inter-conversion identity of configurations:

- **Conversion between all supported formats:** For each supported format, convert a configuration to another format and then back again. Verify that the final configuration is identical to the original configuration.
- **Conversion of complex configurations:** Convert complex configurations with nested structures and different data types. Verify that the final configuration is identical to the original configuration.
- **Conversion of configurations with edge cases:** Convert configurations with edge cases, such as empty values, null values, special characters, and configurations with comments. Verify that the final configuration is identical to the original configuration, including retaining comments.

## Test Execution

The test cases will be executed using a test automation framework. The test framework will generate test reports that will be reviewed by the QA team.

## Additional Considerations

In addition to the above, the following considerations should be taken into account when designing and implementing the testing strategy:

- **Performance:** The test suite should not have a significant impact on the performance of `tc`.
- **Scalability:** The test suite should be scalable to handle a large number of test cases.
- **Integration:** The test suite should be integrated with the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that configurations are tested thoroughly before being released to production.
- **Internationalization and Localization:** Ensure that configuration conversion functionality works correctly with different languages and character encodings to accommodate a global user base.

## Documentation

The test strategy should be documented in a clear and concise manner. The documentation should include the following information:

- **Overview of the test strategy:** A high-level overview of the test strategy, including the goals, objectives, and approach.
- **Test Cases:** A detailed description of each test case, including the input and expected output.
- **Test Execution:** Instructions on how to execute the test cases and generate test reports.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The criteria that must be met for the test cases to be considered successful.

## Conclusion

By following the proposed testing strategy, `tc` can ensure that configurations retain their original structure and information when converted between supported formats. This will improve the reliability and usability of `tc`.
